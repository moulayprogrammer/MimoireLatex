\subsection{Definition}\label{subsec:definition}
A digital image a [m, n] described in a 2D discrete space is derived from an analog image a(x,y) in a 2D continuous space through a sampling process that is frequently referred to as digitization.\\
2D continuous image a(x,y) is divided into N rows and M columns.
The intersection of a row and a column is termed a pixel.
%The value assigned to the integer coordinates [m,n] with {m=0,1,2,\cdot \cdot \cdot,M\neg1} and {n=0,1,2,\cdot \cdot \cdot,N\neg1} is a[m,n].
In fact, in most cases a(x,y) which we might consider to be the physical signal that impinges on the face of a 2D sensor is actually a function of many variables including depth (z), colour (\lambda), and time (t).
