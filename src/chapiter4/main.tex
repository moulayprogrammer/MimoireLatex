Active Contour Model is a very efficient technique of image Segmentation. In this work,
The active contour that was chosen for implementing and comparison was the GVF snake.
But there are also some drawbacks of this model as any other technique.\\
The proposed approach aims to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Have a correct object detection using an initialization by the k-means algorithm .
    \item Accelerate the time of object detection by a parallel execution for the GVF Snake.
\end{itemize}
The proposed method was tested in different images with concavity problems. In the experimental results section,
it was established that our approach achieves the research objective to reduce the computational time.\\
In future we want to use complex shapes with real image (medical), We will also define other metrics of
performance to evaluate and compare our approach with other already existing.
