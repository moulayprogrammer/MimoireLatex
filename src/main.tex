    \qquad Image segmentation by active contours is a method to locate the boundaries of objects,
    using a curve that deforms by minimization of energies, which take a considerable time for execution.
    In this paper, we propose a parallel approach to reduce computational time by using the GVF Snake.
    The proposed approach has two main steps an initialization using k-means, and a parallel execution of the contour.
    Our approach was tested using a different image: the obtained results were encouraging.

    Image segmentation is one of the most important stages in digital image analysis,
    which its objective is to separate the different shapes, structures, or objects that are
    located inside the image. There are different techniques used for the segmentation of pixels
    of interest from the image. Active contour is one of the active models in segmentation techniques,
    which use energy constraints and forces in the image for separation of the interest region.
    Although the computational time of its algorithm is commonly considered as a drawback to the use
    of it in some applications, a lot of research proposed methods to reduce the computational time.\\
    In this work, we propose a parallel implementation approach for the active contour that can perform
    efficiently and reduce the computational time by using an improved model of the classic active contour
    the GVF Snake. The approach we are proposing involves two main steps:  an initialization using the
    k-means algorithm and parallel execution of the GVF snake.\\
    The manuscript is organized as follows. Section (\ref{ch:generalities-on-image-processing}) is devoted to
    image generalizations by citing some definitions and methods of image segmentation and image enhancement.
    Section (\ref{ch:active-contours-:-gvf-snakes}) concentrates mainly on active contour and their
    limit and its improved descendant model GVF snake, which we use in our approach. Sections (\ref{ch:proposed-approach}) describes
    the study and implementation of  the proposed approach. We detail the different steps we have gone through,
    and evaluate the accuracy and applicability of the proposed approach via an experiment. A conclusion is given
    in Section (4).
